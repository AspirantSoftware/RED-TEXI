1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for "Red Bike Taxi". This includes separate applications for users and riders (Android Based Mobile Application), and a multi-role admin panel with API integration. The user and rider applications will be developed in Kotlin/Java, and the API and admin panel will be developed using Laravel. The system will utilize a monolithic architecture with WebSocket for live tracking and two points of failure to ensure high availability and reliability.
1.2 Scope
